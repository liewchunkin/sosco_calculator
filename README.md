# sosco_calculator

Create a mobile app for the members of the Social Security Organisation (SOCSO) to calculate their
monthly contributions. The following table illustrates the percentage of contribution for each income
group for the year 2021.
Category Employee contribution (%) Employer contribution (%)
First 0.5 1.75
Second 0 1.25
All employees who have not attained 60 years of age are required to contribute under the First category.
For employees of 60 years old and above and still working, they are under the Second category and
the contribution of 1.25% is borne by the employer.
The app should include a button for the user to contact the SOCSO using a phone number or a link to
the organisation web site at http://www.socso.gov.my.
